Node Version Manager - Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions
	https://github.com/creationix/nvm
		scroll down and install nvm for windows

main folder
	C:\ProgramData\nvm

install different node js in nvm
	nvm --version
	nvm install 10.15.0
	nvm install 8.11.3 //as u wish

	change node.js version to desired one 
		nvm.use 10.15.0

getting started
	open https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html
	in directory cmd -> npm install express-generator -g
						express --view=pug myapp
	in myapp -> npm install
	run project -> npm start
		open localhost:3000

	public -> contains asset
		images, store logos photo img

	routes -> router ligic to direct, this is key part

	view -> html page
		app.js -> main app, main handler
	controllers -> store all routes handler
	bin -> www-> script for web server


make a url access
	app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views')); //view are included in directory called views
	app.set('view engine', 'pug');//use pug as view engine 

	var indexRouter = require('./routes/index'); // whatever exported to index js saved in indexRouter variable
	var usersRouter = require('./routes/users');//calling another directory to be used as variable

	app.use('/', indexRouter); //we use indexRouter as root which is shown in the first page at localhost:3000
	app.use('/users', usersRouter);



tips make controllers folder -> to make router.get easier
	inside routers/index.js 
		there's a code
			router.get('/', function(req, res, next) { 
		  		res.render('index', { title: 'Express' }); 
			});		

		then we cut the function and leave 

			router.get('/', );		

		then add this session, check below this session, after put something in controllers/index.js

			let lala = require('../controllers/index');
			router.get('/', lala.index);											 
	

	inside controllers/index.js
	
			exports.index = function(req, res, next) { //exports the index and taken by routes/index.js
			  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' }); //index here refers to views/index.pug
			}


	inside app.js
		there's 2 think 
			app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views')); //view are included in directory called views
			app.set('view engine', 'pug');//use pug as view engine


install git as db
	open gitbash cd to directory
		git init-db

	in myapp
		mkdir .gitignore
			type -> node_modules //thi used to not make ur project auto update to git or exclude something unncessary
